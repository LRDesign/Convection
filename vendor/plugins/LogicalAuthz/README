LogicalAuthz
============

Provides simple, fast group based Authorization facilities for Rails apps.

Example
=======


class MyController
  needs_authorization :show, :index #other actions available to anyone
  #needs_authorization <- this form makes the whole controller authorized

  def show
    ...
  end
end


in spec/controller/my_controller_spec.rb:

require 'group_authz/spec_helper'
describe MyController do
  before do
  end
  it "should require authorization" do
    get :show
    controller.should_not be_authorized
  end

  describe "accessed by an authorized user" do
    before do
      login_as_authorized #whatever that means
    end

    it "should accept authorization" do
      controller.should be_authorized
    end
  end
end

in app/views/my_view.html.haml
- if authorized?(:action => show)
  = show_my_url("Show")
- else
  Show


Getting Started
===============

script/plugin install <github link>
rake group_authz:setup
edit the migration to align it with your project - feel free to leave it alone
edit db/seeds.rb to add any starting permissions

Create a config/initializers/authz.rb:
  require 'group_authz/authn_facade/authlogic' 
    #if you aren't using authlogic, you'll need to roll your own
  
  #You only need this line if, for whatever reason, you have a permission model already and need to rename the LogicalAuthz model
  #GroupAuthz::set_permission_model(WeirdPermissionModel) 

  #You only need this if you want Guest users to be able to do some things that logged in users can't:
  #GroupAuthz::unauthorized_groups = Group.find(:all, :conditions => {:name => "Guest"}) 
    
    
(otherwise you'll need to emulate the contents therein somewhere)
In your ApplicationController add:
  include GroupAuthz::Application

If you don't already have a Group model, LogicalAuthz provides one.  If you do...

Gotchas
=======

LogicalAuthz uses flash to pass information about about authorization between controllers - as a result, if you're using a lazy flash display layout, you'll display a bunch of junk to the user.
