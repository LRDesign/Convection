= RailsTabbedPanel

This helper (which is auto-included into ActionView) enables you to easily 
create tabbed panels in Rails.  In this version, only client-side tabbed
panels are supported.  It also requires a minimal amount of CSS support
in your application.  A simple version of the CSS might look like this:

  /* Tabbed Panel Styles */
  .panel_selected {
        display: block;
  }

  .panel_unselected {
        display: none;
  }

  .tab_selected {
        background-color: gray;
  }

  .tab_unselected {
        background-color: white;
  }

  /* End Tabbed Panel Styles */

Basic usage looks like this:

  <% tabbed_panel do |tabctx| %>
     <% tabctx.panel("First Tab", :active => true) do %>
        This is tab one!
     <% end %>
     <% tabctx.panel("Second Tab") do %>
        This is tab two!
     <% end %>
  <% end %>
