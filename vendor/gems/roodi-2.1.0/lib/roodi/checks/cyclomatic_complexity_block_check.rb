    # Checks cyclomatic complexity of a block against a specified limit. 
    # 
    # The cyclomatic complexity is measured by the number of "if", "unless", "elsif", "?:", 
    # "while", "until", "for", "rescue", "case", "when", "&amp;&amp;", "and", "||" and "or" 
    # statements (plus one) in the body of the member. It is a measure of the minimum 
    # number of possible paths through the source and therefore the number of required tests. 
    #
    # Generally, for a block, 1-2 is considered good, 3-4 ok, 5-8 consider re-factoring, and 8+ 
    # re-factor now!
