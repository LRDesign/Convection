=== 2.0.0 / 2008-10-22

* 1 major enhancement

  * Brought on the AWESOME! 4x faster! no known lexing/parsing bugs!

* 71 minor enhancements

  * 1.9: Added Fixnum#ord.
  * 1.9: Added missing Regexp constants and did it so it'd work on 1.9.
  * Added #store_comment and #comments
  * Added StringScanner #begin_of_line?
  * Added a bunch of tests for regexp escape chars, #parse_string, #read_escape, ? numbers, ? whitespace.
  * Added a hack for rubinius' r2l eval bug.
  * Added a new token type tSTRING that bypasses tSTRING_BEG/END entirely. Only does non-interpolated strings and then falls back to the old way. MUCH cleaner tho.
  * Added bin/ruby_parse
  * Added compare rule to Rakefile.
  * Added coverage files/dirs to clean rule.
  * Added file and line numbers to all sexp nodes. Column/ranges to come.
  * Added lex_state change for lvars at the end of yylex.
  * Added lexed comments to defn/defs/class/module nodes.
  * Added stats gathering for yylex. Reordered yylex for avg data
  * Added tSYMBOL token type and parser rule to speed up symbol lexing.
  * Added tally output for getch, unread, and unread_many.
  * Added tests for ambigous uminus/uplus, backtick in cmdarg, square and curly brackets, numeric gvars, eos edge cases, string quoting %<> and %%%.
  * All cases throughout yylex now return directly if they match, no passthroughs.
  * All lexer cases now slurp entire token in one swoop.
  * All zarrays are now just empty arrays.
  * Changed s(:block_arg, :blah) to :"&blah" in args sexp.
  * Cleaned up lexer error handling. Now just raises all over.
  * Cleaned up read_escape and regx_options
  * Cleaned up tokadd_string (for some definition of cleaned).
  * Converted single quoted strings to new tSTRING token type.
  * Coverage is currently 94.4% on lexer.
  * Done what I can to clean up heredoc lexing... still sucks.
  * Flattened resbodies in rescue node. Fixed .autotest file.
  * Folded lex_keywords back in now that it screams.
  * Found very last instanceof ILiteralNode in the code. haha!
  * Got the tests subclassing PTTC and cleaned up a lot. YAY
  * Handle yield(*ary) properly
  * MASSIVELY cleaned out =begin/=end comment processor.
  * Massive overhaul on Keyword class. All hail the mighty Hash!
  * Massively cleaned up ident= edge cases and fixed a stupid bug from jruby.
  * Merged @/@@ scanner together, going to try to do the same everywhere.
  * Refactored fix_arg_lex_state, common across the lexer.
  * Refactored new_fcall into new_call.

  * Refactored tail of yylex into its own method.

  * Removed Token, replaced with Sexp.
  * Removed all parse_number and parse_quote tests.
  * Removed argspush, argscat. YAY!
  * Removed as many token_buffer.split(//)'s as possible. 1 to go.
  * Removed begins from compstmts
  * Removed buffer arg for tokadd_string.
  * Removed crufty (?) solo '@' token... wtf was that anyhow?
  * Removed most jruby/stringio cruft from StringScanner.
  * Removed one unread_many... 2 to go. They're harder.
  * Removed store_comment, now done directly.
  * Removed token_buffer. Now I just use token ivar.
  * Removed use of s() from lexer. Changed the way line numbers are gathered.
  * Renamed *qwords to *awords.
  * Renamed StringScanner to RPStringScanner (a subclass) to fix namespace trashing.
  * Renamed parse to process and aliased to parse.
  * Renamed token_buffer to string_buffer since that arcane shit still needs it.
  * Resolved the rest of the lexing issues I brought up w/ ruby-core.
  * Revamped tokadd_escape.
  * Rewrote Keyword and KWtable.
  * Rewrote RubyLexer using StringScanner.
  * Rewrote tokadd_escape. 79 lines down to 21.
  * Split out lib/ruby_parser_extras.rb so lexer is standalone.

  * lex_strterm is now a plain array, removed RubyLexer#s(...).
  * yield and super now flatten args.

* 21+ bug fixes:

  * I'm sure this list is missing a lot:
  * Fixed 2 bugs both involving attrasgn (and ilk) esp when lhs is an array.
  * Fixed a bug in the lexer for strings with single digit hex escapes.
  * Fixed a bug parsing: a (args) { expr }... the space caused a different route to be followed and all hell broke loose.
  * Fixed a bug with x\n=beginvar not putting begin back.
  * Fixed attrasgn to have arglists, not arrays.
  * Fixed bug in defn/defs with block fixing.
  * Fixed class/module's name slot if colon2/3.
  * Fixed dstr with empty interpolation body.
  * Fixed for 1.9 string/char changes.
  * Fixed lexer BS wrt determining token type of words.
  * Fixed lexer BS wrt pass through values and lexing words. SO STUPID.
  * Fixed lexing of floats.
  * Fixed lexing of identifiers followed by equals. I hope.
  * Fixed masgn with splat on lhs
  * Fixed new_super to deal with block_pass correctly.
  * Fixed parser's treatment of :colon2 and :colon3.
  * Fixed regexp scanning of escaped numbers, ANY number is valid, not just octs.
  * Fixed string scanning of escaped octs, allowing 1-3 chars.
  * Fixed unescape for \n
  * Fixed: omg this is stupid. '()' was returning bare nil
  * Fixed: remove_begin now goes to the end, not sure why it didn't before.
