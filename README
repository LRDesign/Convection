== Convection

Convection is an open-source file upload tool for businesses and contractors
who need to host and swap files with their clients in a secure manner.  Convection is designed to meet the needs of companies who need to swap files
with clients or contractors under the following constraints:

  * Secure encrypted file transfer (via SSL)
  * Access control for files, with group permissions
  * Web based access so that access is not limited by firewalls that may
    restrict access to SFTP or other port 22 solutions.

== Version

Convection is currently in version 1.1.0.   If you have suggestions for future versions, please contact us: http://lrdesign.com or contribute code (see Contributing, below). 

== Installing

Database:
	database.yml.example -> database.yml

Seeds:
	rake db:seed

Gems:
	rake gems:install


== Progress Bar (Experimental)

Convection can incorporate an AJAX progress bar for uploads; this may be turned on or off in preferences.   This feature is only supported on Apache/passenger, and requires installation of the upload_progress module:

More information on how this is implemented may be found here:

forking the project on GitHub and issuing a pull request when you have made
changes.  If we like your changes, we will incorporate them into the master
project.   You may, of course, make and maintain your own fork at any time.
